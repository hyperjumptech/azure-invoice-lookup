title: Authentication
---

The application uses a password-less authentication system without the need for database.

## The flow

- User enters email address
- System checks if email is in `ALLOWED_EMAIL_ADDRESSES`
- If allowed, creates 5-minute JWT magic link token
- Sends email with magic link via SMTP
- User clicks link, which verifies the token
- System creates 1-day session JWT and sets HTTP-only cookie
- User is redirected to `/invoice`

## Allowed email addresses

To prevent unauthorized access, the application only allows access to email addresses in the `ALLOWED_EMAIL_ADDRESSES` environment variable. If you want to add a new email address, you need to update the environment variable and rebuild and redeploy the application.
